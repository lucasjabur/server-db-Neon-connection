# server-db-connection

This repository is being used as a complement to the https://github.com/lucasjabur/learning-NodeJS repository in order to provide data to the database via a HTML form, which has not been done before.
For this I'm using an online platform called Neon Serverless Postgres (https://neon.tech) as my database.
